This is a Multiplayer version of the board game Sequence. The board game is essentially connect 5, but with cards.

# Installation
Either download the release package, or the python files. To run it from the python files, you will require the following libraries:
- pygame

To run it from the python files, you will need to download the following files:
- GUI_home.py
- GUI_game.py
- network.py
- server.py
- Red.png
- Blue.png
- Green.png
- Sequence!!!.png
- The 'Cards' folder (with all the images in it)

To use it, just run the file 'GUI_home.py', then the rest should be self-explanatory.

Unless you are downloading the latest release package (v1.2.0), you will need to first run run 'server.exe', and then you can run the 'main.exe' (Inside main.zip) file to play the game.
