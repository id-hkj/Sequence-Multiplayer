# Sequence-Multiplayer
This is a Multiplayer version of the board game Sequence. The board game is essentially connect 5, but with cards.

# Installation
Either download the release package, or the python files. To run it from the python files, you will require the following libraries:
- pygame

To run it from the python files, you will need to download the following files:
- GUI_home.py
- GUI_game.py
- network.py
- server.py
- Red.png
- Blue.png
- (Green.png) - not yet necessary, but will be after Issue #5 is added
- Sequence!!!.png
- The 'Cards' folder (with all the images in it)

To use it, just run the file 'GUI_home.py', then the rest should be self-explanatory.

The release packages have an older version of this project.
To run it from them, first run 'server.exe', then you can run the 'main.exe' to play the game.
