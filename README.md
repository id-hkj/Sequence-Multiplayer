# Sequence-Multiplayer
This is a Multiplayer version of the board game Sequence. The board game is essentially connect 5, but with cards.

# Installation
Either download the release package, or the python files. To run it from the python files, you will require the following libraries:
- pygame

To run it from the python files, you will need to start the server by running 'server.py', then you can start the program by running 'main.py'. You will have to enter the server ip address, which is printed at the start of the server program.

Running it from the release package is similar - you need to run 'server.exe' first, then you can run the main program.
